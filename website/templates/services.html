          <h1 class="service-title">Stretching</h1>
          <p>Stretching can help increase your flexibility, which is an important factor of fitness, but it can also improve your posture, reduce stress and body aches, and more. Stretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion.</p>

          <p>A healthful diet typically includes nutrient-dense foods from all major food groups, including lean proteins, whole grains, healthful fats, and fruits and vegetables of many colors. Healthful eating also means replacing foods that contain trans fats, added salt, and sugar with more nutritious options.</p>
